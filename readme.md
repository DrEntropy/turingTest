# Comparison of Julia's Turing and PYMC for ODE inference

* Goal is to compare the same ODE parameter inference problem implemented in TuringLang and in PYMC (using sunode) 

* For the Julia part, don't forget to `activate turingTest` and `instantiate` (https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/environments/)
